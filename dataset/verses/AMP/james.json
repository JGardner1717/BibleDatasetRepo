          { "verse": 2, "text": "Consider it nothing but joy, my brothers and sisters, whenever you fall into various trials." },
          { "verse": 3, "text": "Be assured that the testing of your faith [through experience] produces endurance [leading to spiritual maturity, and inner peace]." },
          { "verse": 4, "text": "And let endurance have its perfect result and do a thorough work, so that you may be perfect and completely developed [in your faith], lacking in nothing." },
          { "verse": 5, "text": "If any of you lacks wisdom [to guide him through a decision or circumstance], he is to ask of [our benevolent] God, who gives to everyone generously and without rebuke or blame, and it will be given to him." },
          { "verse": 6, "text": "But he must ask [for wisdom] in faith, without doubting [God’s willingness to help]. For the one who doubts is like a billowing surge of the sea that is blown about and tossed by the wind." },
          { "verse": 7, "text": "For such a person ought not to think or expect that he will receive anything [at all] from the Lord," },

          { "verse": 11, "text": "For the sun rises with a scorching wind and withers the grass; its flower falls off and its beauty fades away; so too will the rich man, in the midst of his pursuits, fade away." },
          { "verse": 12, "text": "Blessed [happy, spiritually prosperous, favored by God] is the man who is steadfast under trial and perseveres when tempted; for when he has passed the test and been approved, he will receive the [victor’s] crown of life which the Lord has promised to those who love Him." },
          { "verse": 13, "text": "Let no one say when he is tempted, 'I am being tempted by God'; for temptation does not originate from God, but from our own flaws, for God cannot be tempted by [what is] evil, and He Himself tempts no one." },
          { "verse": 14, "text": "But each one is tempted when he is dragged away, enticed and baited [to commit sin] by his own [worldly] desire (lust, passion)." },

          { "verse": 18, "text": "It was of His own will that He gave us birth [as His children] by the word of truth, so that we would be a kind of firstfruits of His creatures [a prime example of what He created to be set apart to Himself—sanctified, made holy for His divine purposes]." },
          { "verse": 19, "text": "Understand this, my beloved brothers and sisters. Let everyone be quick to hear [be a careful, thoughtful listener], slow to speak [a speaker of carefully chosen words], and slow to anger [patient, reflective, forgiving];" },
          { "verse": 20, "text": "for the [resentful, deep-seated] anger of man does not produce the righteousness of God [that standard of behavior which He requires from us]." },
          { "verse": 21, "text": "So get rid of all uncleanness and all that remains of wickedness, and with a humble spirit receive the word [of God], which is implanted [actually rooted in your heart], which is able to save your souls." },
          { "verse": 22, "text": "But prove yourselves doers of the word [actively and continually obeying God’s precepts], and not merely listeners [who hear the word but fail to internalize its meaning], deluding yourselves [by unsound reasoning contrary to the truth]." },
          { "verse": 23, "text": "For if anyone only listens to the word without obeying it, he is like a man who looks very carefully at his natural face in a mirror;" },

          { "verse": 25, "text": "But he who looks carefully into the perfect law, the law of liberty, and faithfully abides by it, not having become a careless listener who forgets but an active doer [who obeys], he will be blessed and favored by God in what he does [in his life of obedience]." },
          { "verse": 26, "text": "If anyone thinks himself to be religious [scrupulously observant of the rituals of his faith], and does not control his tongue but deludes his own heart, this person’s religion is worthless (futile, barren)." },
          { "verse": 27, "text": "Pure and unblemished religion [as it is expressed in outward acts] in the sight of our God and Father is this: to visit and look after the fatherless and the widows in their distress, and to keep oneself uncontaminated by the [secular] world." }
